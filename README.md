These are the problems that I've solved in my Competitive Programming and Data Structures classes. In it we solved problems from popular Competitive programming paradigms like Simulation, Ad-Hoc, Brute Force, Divide & Conquer, Greedy, and Dynamic Programming.

I don't have any of the examples from Simulation-Brute Force because it didn't occur to me that saving my solutions would be a good idea. Recently we have been doing a variety of problems so I do have a few examples from them but not many.
